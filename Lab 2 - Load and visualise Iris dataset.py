# # Lab 2: Data Exploration - Iris Data 

# ### Visualise Iris dataset

# In[1]:


# First, we'll import pandas, a data processing and CSV file I/O library
import pandas as pd

# We'll also import seaborn, a Python graphing library
import warnings # current version of seaborn generates a bunch of warnings that we'll ignore
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
sns.set(style="white", color_codes=True)

# Next, we'll load the Iris flower dataset, which is in the "../input/" directory
iris = pd.read_csv("D:/APU/CT108-3-3 - OCDS/Lab Sessions/Lab2 - Data Exploration/Iris.csv") # the iris dataset is now a Pandas DataFrame

# Let's see what's in the iris data - Jupyter notebooks print the result of the last thing you do
iris.head()

# Let's see how many examples we have of each species
iris["Species"].value_counts()


# In[39]:


plot = iris["Species"].value_counts().plot(kind = 'bar', color = (['green','red','blue'])) 


# In[35]:


# The first way we can plot things is using the .plot extension from Pandas dataframes
# We'll use this to make a scatterplot of the Iris features.
iris.plot(kind="scatter", x="SepalLengthCm", y="SepalWidthCm", color='red')


# In[54]:


# We can also use the seaborn library to make a similar plot
# A seaborn jointplot shows bivariate scatterplots and univariate histograms in the same figure
sns.jointplot(x="SepalLengthCm", y="SepalWidthCm", data=iris, height=5)


# In[5]:


# One piece of information missing in the plots above is what species each plant is
# We'll use seaborn's FacetGrid to color the scatterplot by species
sns.FacetGrid(iris, hue="Species", height=5)    .map(plt.scatter, "SepalLengthCm", "SepalWidthCm")    .add_legend()


# In[6]:


#One piece of information missing in the plots above is what species each plant is
# We'll use seaborn's FacetGrid to color the scatterplot by species
sns.FacetGrid(iris, hue="Species", height=10)    .map(plt.scatter, "SepalLengthCm", "SepalWidthCm")    .add_legend()


# In[7]:


# We can look at an individual feature in Seaborn through a boxplot
sns.boxplot(x="Species", y="PetalLengthCm", data=iris)


# In[8]:


# One way we can extend this plot is adding a layer of individual points on top of
# it through Seaborn's striplot
# 
# We'll use jitter=True so that all the points don't fall in single vertical lines
# above the species
#
# Saving the resulting axes as ax each time causes the resulting plot to be shown
# on top of the previous axes
ax = sns.boxplot(x="Species", y="PetalLengthCm", data=iris)
ax = sns.stripplot(x="Species", y="PetalLengthCm", data=iris, jitter=True, edgecolor="gray")


# In[9]:


# A violin plot combines the benefits of the previous two plots and simplifies them
# Denser regions of the data are fatter, and sparser thiner in a violin plot
sns.violinplot(x="Species", y="PetalLengthCm", data=iris, height=6)


# In[10]:


# A final seaborn plot useful for looking at univariate relations is the kdeplot,
# which creates and visualizes a kernel density estimate of the underlying feature
sns.FacetGrid(iris, hue="Species", height=6)    .map(sns.kdeplot, "PetalLengthCm")    .add_legend()


# In[11]:


# Another useful seaborn plot is the pairplot, which shows the bivariate relation
# between each pair of features
# 
# From the pairplot, we'll see that the Iris-setosa species is separataed from the other
# two across all feature combinations
sns.pairplot(iris.drop("Id", axis=1), hue="Species", height=3)


# In[12]:


# The diagonal elements in a pairplot show the histogram by default
# We can update these elements to show other things, such as a kde
sns.pairplot(iris.drop("Id", axis=1), hue="Species", height=3, diag_kind="kde")


# In[13]:


# Now that we've covered seaborn, let's go back to some of the ones we can make with Pandas
# We can quickly make a boxplot with Pandas on each feature split out by species
iris.drop("Id", axis=1).boxplot(by="Species", figsize=(12, 6))


# In[15]:


# One cool more sophisticated technique pandas has available is called Andrews Curves
# Andrews Curves involve using attributes of samples as coefficients for Fourier series
# and then plotting these
from pandas.plotting import andrews_curves
andrews_curves(iris.drop("Id", axis=1), "Species")


# In[16]:


# Another multivariate visualization technique pandas has is parallel_coordinates
# Parallel coordinates plots each feature on a separate column & then draws lines
# connecting the features for each data sample
from pandas.plotting import parallel_coordinates
parallel_coordinates(iris.drop("Id", axis=1), "Species")


# In[17]:


# A final multivariate visualization technique pandas has is radviz
# Which puts each feature as a point on a 2D plane, and then simulates
# having each sample attached to those points through a spring weighted
# by the relative value for that feature
from pandas.plotting import radviz
radviz(iris.drop("Id", axis=1), "Species")
